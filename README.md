# Coherence & Spring Refresh Ahead Example
An example of a configuration for a coherence read ahead cache with Spring

Spring & Coherence info can be found [here] (http://coherence-community.github.io/coherence-spring-integration/1.0.1/). 

Note: 
For use with Partitioned (Distributed) and Near cache topologies: Read-through/write-through caching (and variants) are intended for use only with the Partitioned (Distributed) cache topology (and by extension, Near cache). Local caches support a subset of this functionality. Replicated and Optimistic caches should not be used.
